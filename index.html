            In history, I have a project where I make a webpage on Google sites. Google sites kinda sucks though, so I took it a step further by actually making one where I write code for it. I wrote this in HTML (duh), CSS (also duh), typescript, js, and scss. I was initially going to use react to make this website, but I realized that react is kinda overkill for a static website. So, base HTML it is!
